    <h1>About this Game</h1>
    <p>Why bother making a cheap knockoff?</p>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a computer science major at UMass Amherst.
        Although the courses I am taking are interesting, they don't cover HTML, JavaScript, CSS, or web development,
        which I think are pretty important in today's world. So, to counteract this, I decided to take matters into my
        own hands.
        Hence, the creation of this simple game. I won't lie; AI was used in the creation of this game. But, rather than
        allow the technology to
        take away my role as a developer, I used it more as an advanced Google Search. Seriously, if ChatGPT had a
        prompt history like Google, it
        would read: "html align picture right," "css picture right," and "does footer go inside body html," etc. My goal
        with this project was
        not to create an amazing game (although that just happened to be the result). I instead sought to learn HTML,
        CSS, and JavaScript. Now, being
        deep in the development process, I can confirm that this goal was met.
