*DEV JOURNAL*

Nov. 7 PM - 
Made some necessary progress. Didn't do a ton of fun stuff today, but fixed the prices so they actually look and work well. That was pretty much it. I added some new bonus boxes for future upgrades just to ensure they work properly; I'll have to come up with actual upgrades in the future (perhaps taking inspiration from Cookie Clicker...). Overall, not an amazingly fun day but a necessary one to refine the game.

Made some pretty cool progress. I got both buttons working in the sense that you can't buy them unless you have enough bits. The manager increases the bits per seconds (bps) by 1, and the upgrade increases clicking power by 2x. Basic stuff, but it's essential for a clicker game. The problem I'm now facing is aligning the price of each upgrade/manager. It's stuck in the bottom left of my box, and I'm not sure why. I mean, I know it's because I used span to add "Price:" before the actual variable, but it shouldn't be giving me this much trouble. Whatever, it's cool. After I figure that out, I'll add a few more managers and a bps button somewhere on the screen. Then I'll go for a few more upgrades, then I'll work on having each upgrade be linked to somewhere on the skill/binary tree. Sounds good! I'm really enjoying this project for sure, even if CSS is confusing sometimes.

Made good progress. I got the buttons working with the price of the upgrades (which'll easily translate to managers too). I also made it so that you could only buy an upgrade if you had enough bits, which can also translate very easily to the managers. Tomorrow I think I'll work on implementing managers and having them contribute to the total amount of bits every second or so. That'll be more JavaScript. But I'm proud of my work with the CSS - it certainly wasn't easy but I used some flex-wrap stuff I learned. Very fun. Good progress today! I'm sure tomorrow will be great too!

Made good progress. I met with Mori this afternoon and he explained a lot of ideas to me, which helped greatly. He didn't write all my code though; important distinction. I also did a few more freeCodeCamp lessons on flexbox so you could say I'm starting to get the hang of it. Like I said before, once this basic skeleton is done, I imagine it'll be smoother sailing. I'll just have to learn more about styling, which seems a lot more fun! I can't wait for the animations and dropdown menus...

Made some ok progress. Definitely not what I wanted to have done. I'm still grasping the idea of flex containers and how to organize elements within them. I'm starting to get it, but need some more practice to fully understand. But, once I do understand this, I'll be set for designing the rest of the layout for the game interface. And after that, it's all logic and polish! This part I'm in now is probably the hardest, which is encouraging!

Nov. 3 PM - 
Make some alright progress. I managed to get the upgrade boxes existing in the general right area, but I'm not 100% sure how it all works together. I think I'll wrap the upgrade/manager boxes inside another div or container to better control them. It's a real struggle to put HTML elements side-by-side! I'm enjoying it though, still fun.

Actually made some solid progress today. I got the image up on the screen and made it clickable. CSS is starting to make a bit more sense to me now, which is awesome! I'll be working on the upgrades bar next, but I don't imagine that being too complicated. In reality, CSS isn't super critical thinking; it's kinda just knowing how to arrange stuff. Still, it's fun to learn!
