Made some ok progress. Definitely not what I wanted to have done. I'm still grasping the idea of flex containers and how to organize elements within them. I'm starting to get it, but need some more practice to fully understand. But, once I do understand this, I'll be set for designing the rest of the layout for the game interface. And after that, it's all logic and polish! This part I'm in now is probably the hardest, which is encouraging!

Make some alright progress. I managed to get the upgrade boxes existing in the general right area, but I'm not 100% sure how it all works together. I think I'll wrap the upgrade/manager boxes inside another div or container to better control them. It's a real struggle to put HTML elements side-by-side! I'm enjoying it though, still fun.

Actually made some solid progress today. I got the image up on the screen and made it clickable. CSS is starting to make a bit more sense to me now, which is awesome! I'll be working on the upgrades bar next, but I don't imagine that being too complicated. In reality, CSS isn't super critical thinking; it's kinda just knowing how to arrange stuff. Still, it's fun to learn!
