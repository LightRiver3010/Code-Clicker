Actually made some solid progress today. I got the image up on the screen and made it clickable. CSS is starting to make a bit more sense to me now, which is awesome! I'll be working on the upgrades bar next, but I don't imagine that being too complicated. In reality, CSS isn't super critical thinking; it's kinda just knowing how to arrange stuff. Still, it's fun to learn!
